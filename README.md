# EZMail - CS50W Project

This repository contains my project submission for the "Mail" project, part of Harvard University's CS50â€™s Web Programming with Python and JavaScript course. My contribution focused exclusively on developing the front-end aspects of the email client, utilizing HTML and JavaScript to enable users to send, receive, and manage emails through API calls.
